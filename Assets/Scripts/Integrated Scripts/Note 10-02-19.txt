Note to self (-T)

we need to tidy up the filestructure a bit before moving on ;-;

to include moving the contents of `Integrated Scripts` somewhere more logical 
(and unifying scripts outside the scripts folder without good reason)

but for now, the scripts from the other version are going here.
